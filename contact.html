					<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

				<div class="panel-body content-body">
					<dl>
					  	<dt>Do I have to have a perfect body to have boudoir photos taken?</dt>
				  		<dd>
				  			No, absolutely not!  The beauty of boudoir is that it's for <strong>REAL</strong> women out there.  Most of us have stretch marks, jiggly parts, or things that sag or bulge.  The idea is to take your best assets (we all have <strong>AT LEAST</strong> one) and play those up.  I've worked with women of all shapes and sizes.  With a little creative posing, flattering lighting, and a little confidence, anyone can look great.  This means YOU!
				  		</dd>
					</dl>  		
					<dl>
					  	<dt>Can I bring a girlfriend to the shoot?</dt>
					  	<dd>
					  		Getting a photo shoot done can be a scary experience.  If you would like to bring a girlfriend along for moral support you are more than welcome to do so.  Hair and makeup can take about an hour and they are welcome to join us. During your actual photo shoot however they will be seated in the lobby.
					  	</dd>
					</dl>
					<dl>
						<dt>Can I bring my boyfriend or husband to the photo shoot?</dt>
						<dd>
							Out of respect to other women that may be at the studio the same time you are, we ask that you <strong>DO NOT</strong> bring your husband or boyfriend.
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<dl>
				     	<dt>Should I tan before my shoot?</dt>
						<dd>
							<strong>TANS DO NOT</strong> photograph well and end results tend to look orange. Keep in mind that if you arrive with a deep tan or are peeling, you assume responsibly for the end results. We cannot be held responsible to correct spray tan, tan lines, or peeling skin in post-production. If you desire a tan skin tone in your final photo's please make us aware and we will enhance your skin tone in post production.
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<dl>
						<dt>Is my hair and makeup included in the session?</dt>
						<dd>
							Yes, we do provide full hair and makeup for your shoot.
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<dl>
					    <dt>Do I bring my own outfits, or do you supply them?</dt>
					    <dd>
					    	You bring your own outfits, including shoes and jewelry.  This assures that your items fit properly and are flattering.  Our team will be available to help you put together outfit options that will best suit your session.
					    </dd>
					</dl>
					<dl>
						<dt>What should I wear?</dt>
						<dd>
							Wear what you feel sexy in.  If your more of a boy-short and tank top kind of girl, don't force yourself into lacy lingerie if it's out of your comfort zone.  Most women own one or two things that they feel fabulous and sexy in.  Shopping for new items isn't necessary, but if you don't own anything photo-worthy, then doing a bit of shopping is recommended.  You don't have to spend a ton of money - there are plenty of discount stores that have really cute and inexpensive lingerie.  A sexy pair of shoes is also a good thing to have on hand, as well as any jewelry you may want to use.  Keep in mind, you don't have to show a lot of skin in your photos!  If you feel more comfortable in a silky robe, or a pretty dress, that is perfectly ok.  Men's items are also popular -  so grab one of your guy's button-up  shirts or his favorite sports jersey.

					<dl>
				     	<dt>What about privacy? Who will see my photos?</dt>
						<dd>
							Privacy is extremely important to us, and your photos will never be shown or released to anyone but you unless otherwise agreed upon in writing. I only work with professional photo labs that are located out of state, so no need to worry about anyone you may know at a local photo lab seeing your photo either.
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<dl>
						<dt>Will I be able to view my photos on the day of the photo shoot?</dt>
						<dd>
							Yes, we schedule a same day viewing with all of our sessions.  After your shoot we will break for an hour for lunch and come back to our viewing room where we will sit down together and view your proofs.  You will place your order and pay for it at this time.
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<dl>
						<dt>How long will it take for me to receive my photos?</dt>
						<dd>
							We will get you your proofs to you via an online viewing album within the first five days of your shoot.  Any product you wish to purchase will take 6-8 weeks for us to get in the mail due to edits and printing.
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<dl>
						<dt>How far in advance should I book my session?</dt>
						<dd>
							To be sure to get the appointment date and time you desire, book as far in advance as possible.  If you are taking your photos for a special occasion, such as a wedding or anniversary, be sure to schedule your shoot at least one month in advance of your event to be sure that your gift is ready in time. 
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<dl>
						<dt>When is the session fee due?</dt>
						<dd>
							Half of the session fee is due upon booking to hold your appointment date and time.  The remainder of the session fee may be paid anytime prior to your shoot, or on the day of.
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<dl>
						<dt>What is your cancellation policy?</dt>
						<dd>
							Life happens, and sometimes rescheduling your appointment is unavoidable.  If you must reschedule your appointment, please give at least 72 hours notice.  When proper notice is given, you may reschedule your appointment one time free of charge.  However, if you reschedule more than once, or do not give 72 hours notice, a $100 rescheduling fee will be charged.  If you cancel your appointment, or do not show up, your deposit will be forfeited.  These policies ensure the success of our business, and your understanding and cooperation is appreciated.
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<dl>
						<dt>What forms of payment do you accept?</dt>
						<dd>
							We accept all forms of payment, including cash, credit/debit card, or check.
						</dd>
					</dl>
					<dl>
						<dt>What are your hours/days of operation?</dt>
